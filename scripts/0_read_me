1_data_import.R
  Rerun every time open project.
  This is set up to create separate subset df. by category, with the idea that they could be
  merged if needed for particular analyses. 
  Most of these only include a portion of the vars in that category, the rest are commented out.
  Can be added in as needed. Hence, I didn't save a data file from the final step that combines them 
  all so that we don't forget which are included. 
  ** at some point might want to save the data file for easier retrieval.
